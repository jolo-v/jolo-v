ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Joaquin Villanueva

I'm a data scientist with a bachelor's degree in psychology and a master's degree in statistics. I have a keen interest in analyzing data and deploying machine learning
models to solve business problems and add value to the business. I have a deep appreciation of the beauty of the underlying theory of statistics and machine learning and
an even greater sense of awe towards how they could be applied in real life to solve real problems.

Outside my profession I am an avid traveler and hiker, as well as a musician, reader, and enjoyer of fine coffee, food, and everything gastronomic.
